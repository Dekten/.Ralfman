A Day In The Life
Lennon/McCartney


I read the news today oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today oh, boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I love to turn you on.


Woke up, got out of bed
dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
and looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ah


I read the news today oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on


A Hard Day's Night
Lennon/McCartney


It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

So why I love to come home
'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
everything seems to be all right
when I'm home
feeling you holding me tight, tight

Yeah, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right, Oh!

So why I love to come home
'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be all right
when I'm home
feeling you holding me tight, all through the night

Yeah, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right


A Taste Of Honey
Marlow/Scott


A taste of honey
tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du

I dream of you first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
A taste of honey
tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du

I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey, and you
Do dut don du, to dut don du

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still though we're far apart
A taste of honey
A taste of honey
tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du

I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back, I'll come back
for the honey, for the honey
and you


Across The Universe
Lennon/McCartney


Words are flying out like 
endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
are drifting thorough my open mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which 
dance before me like a million eyes
That call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a 
restless wind inside a letter box
they tumble blindly as 
they make their way across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter shades of earth
are ringing through my open views
inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which
shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva

Morrison/Russell

They're gonna put me in the movies

We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely

The biggest fool that ever hit the big time

I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal

might win an Oscar you can never tell
the movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can plat the part so well

The biggest fool that ever hit the big time

Lennon/McCartney


Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

The lips I am missing

All You Need Is Love
Lennon/McCartney


Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how the play the game
It's easy

There's nothing you can make that can't me made
No on you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love 
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

All you need is love
All you need is love 
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
No where you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
Love is all you need

That is all you need


And I Love Her
Lennon/McCartney


I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I 
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
will never die
And I love her, ooh


And Your Bird Can Sing
Lennon/McCartney


You say you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
you don't get me

You say you've seen the seven wonders
And you bird is green
But you can't see me
you can't see me

When your prized possessions
start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be round, I'll be round

When your bird is broken
will it bring you down
You may be awoken
I'll be round, I'll be round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me


Anna (Go To Him)
Alexander


Anna, you come and ask me girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him (Anna) Go with him (Anna)

Anna, girl, before go now
I want you to know, now
That I still love you so,
But if he loves you more,
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
oh now
But every girl I ever had breaks my heart
And leaves me sad,
what am I, what am I supposed to do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Anna, just one more thing girl
You five back your ring to me
And I will set you free,
go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I ever had breaks my heart
And leaves me sad,
what am I, what am I supposed to do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

Anna, just one more thing girl
You five back your ring to me
And I will set you free,
go with him (Anna) go with him (Anna)
You can go with him girl (Anna) go with him


Another Girl
Lennon/McCartney


For I have got another girl, another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today well I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter that all the girls and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop

For I have got another girl 
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl 
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

For I have got another girl 
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
For I have got another girl 


Any Time At All
Lennon/McCartney


Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There is nothing I won't do
If you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight and I'll come to you

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
all you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there

Any time at all

Ask Me Why
Lennon/McCartney


I love you
Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
that it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I,
should never never never be blue

Now you're mine 
my happiness dear makes me cry
And in time
you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe, it's happened to me
I can't conceive of anymore misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I love you
Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
that it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I,
should never never never be blue

Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I can't believe, it's happened to me
I can't conceive of anymore misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you, you, you


Baby It's You
David/Bacharach/Williams

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart

But how many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself
Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you

You should hear what they say about you (cheat, cheat)
They say, they say you never never ever been true (cheat, cheat)

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you

Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
Don't leave me all alone


Baby, You're A Rich Man
Lennon/McCartney


How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you traveled very far
far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
How often have you been there
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E
happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play

Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too


Baby's In Black
Lennon/McCartney


Oh dear, what can I do
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do
She thinks of him
and so she dressed in black
And though he'll never come back
she's dressed in black

Oh, dear, what can I do
baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me oh, what can I do?

I think of her
but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim,
she thinks of him

Oh, how long will it take
till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me oh, what can I do

She thinks of him
and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
she's dressed in black

Oh, dear what can I do
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me oh, what can I do?

He won't do nothing right, just a sitting got to look so good

Lennon/McCartney


For the benefit of Mr. Kite
there will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there

Over men and horses hoops and garters

In this way Mr. K will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K
performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
as Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messers K. and H. assure the public
their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz

The band begins at ten to six 
when Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate

Having been some days in preparation
a splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Blackbird
Lennon/McCartney


Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All you life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise


Blue Jay Way
Harrison


There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep

Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep

Don't Pass Me By
Starkey


I listen for your foot steps
Coming up the drive
Listen for you foot steps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for you knock, dear
on my old front door

Does it mean you don't love me anymore

I hear the clock a ticking

I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself

And you lost you hair
You said that you would be late
About and hour or two

Eleanor Rigby
Lennon/McCartney


Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Fixing A Hole
Lennon/McCartney


I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
and stops my mind from wandering
where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran though the door
and kept my mind from wandering
where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
See the people standing there
who disagree and never win 
and wonder why they don't get in my door

I'm painting my room in a colorful way,
and when my mind is wandering
there I will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people run around
they worry me and never ask me
why they don't get past my door

I'm taking my time for a number of things
that weren't important yesterday
and I still go

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
and stops my mind from wandering
where it will go
where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
and stops my mind from wandering
where it will go


The Fool On The Hill
Lennon/McCartney


Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin 
is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never seem to notice

But the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices 
is talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him

The fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
oh


For No One
Lennon/McCartney


You day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words 
of kindness linger on 
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't 
feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of live behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of live behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
but now he's gone
She doesn't need him
your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things 
she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of live behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years


For You Blue
Harrison


Because you're sweet and lovely girl, I love you

I'm living every moment girl, for you

Walk, walk cat walk

You looket at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too
I'm having the blues

Getting Better
Lennon/McCartney


It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers that taught me weren't cool
You're holding me down

Girl
Lennon/McCartney


Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl 
you want so much it make you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl, Girl, Girl

When I think of all the times 
I tried to hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl, girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
she's cool, ooh, oo, oo, oo
Girl, girl, girl

Was she told when she was young
that pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back 
to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead
Ah, girl, girl, girl
Girl


Glass Onion
Lennon/McCartney


I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus is Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he's living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Tryin' to make a dovetail joint
Looking through a glass onion


Golden Slumbers
Lennon/McCartney


Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

I've got something I an laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

Good day sunshine

Good day sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

Then we lie beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she know she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

Good Morning Good Morning
Lennon/McCartney


Good morning good morning
good morning good morning
good morning, a

Nothing to do to save his life
call his wife in
Nothing say but what a day
how's your but been
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got noting to say but it's O.K.

Good morning good morning
good morning a

Going to work don't want to go
feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam
then you're in town

Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

After a while you start to smile
now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning good morning
good morning a
 
People running 'round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time
glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt
no you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning good morning
good morning good morning


Goodnight
Lennon/McCartney


Now it's time to say goodnight
good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light

Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Mm, mm, mm

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
(Good night, good night everybody
everybody everywhere, goodnight)


Got To Get You Into My Life
Lennon/McCartney


I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
could see another kind of mind there
Ooo, then I suddenly see you
Ooo, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't hide
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooo, you were meant to be near me
Ooo, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooo, then I suddenly see you
Ooo, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
could see another kind of mind there
Ooo, then I suddenly see you
Ooo, did I tell you I need you
Every single day 


Happiness Is A Warm Gun
Lennon/McCartney


She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do
oh, yeah
She's well acquainted with 
the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pain
The man in the crowd with the 
multicolored mirror on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his 
hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which 
he ate and donated to the National Trust

I need a fix cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause I'm going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun mama
When I hold you in my arms
and I feel my finger on you trigger
I know nobody can do no harm
Because Happiness is a warm gun mama
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun
Ah, don't you know that
Happiness is a warm gun mama

Help!
Lennon/McCartney


I need somebody (Help)
Not just anybody (Help)
You know I need someone (Help)

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone
I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me

And now my life hand changed in oh, so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like
I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone
I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, me, me, Oo

It's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here

Here, There and Everywhere
Lennon/McCartney


To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her  

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each on believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her  

I will be there, and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere


Hey Bulldog
Lennon/McCartney


Sheep dog standing in the rain
Bull  grog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is 
measured out in miles
What make you think you're 
something special when you smile

Childlike no on understand
Jack knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is 
measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
to listen to you fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is 
measured out in you
You think you know but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Hey Bulldog

The minute you let her under your skin
The you begin to make it better

By marking his world a little colder

Honey Pie
Lennon/McCartney


She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's in the big time
In the USA
And if she could only gear me
this is what I'd say

Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please home

Oh, Honey Pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of you Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the though of meeting you 
makes me weak in the knee

Oh, honey pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
kindly send her sailing back to me
T. T. Tee, Now honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy 
Son won't you please come home
Honey pie, come back to me
Come, come back to me, Honey pie
ha, ha, ha
Honey pie, honey pie


I Am The Walrus
Lennon/McCartney


I am he as you are he as you are me
and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
see how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
you let your face grow long

I am the eggman
they are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Mr. city policeman sitting
pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
you let your knickers down

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Sitting in an English garden 
waiting for the sun
If the sun don't shine you get a tan 
from standing in the English rain

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Expert, texpert choking smokers
don't you think the joker laughs at you
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina pilchard 
climbing up the Eiffel tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking
Edgar Allen Poe

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob
Goo goo g' joob
Goo goo g' goo

I Don't Want To Spoil The Party
Lennon/McCartney

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
So I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone,
please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong
I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show

I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong
I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

I Want To Hold Your Hand
Lennon/McCartney


I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something

I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

Oh please say to me

and please say to me
you'll let me hold your hand
Not, let me hold your hand

I Want To Tell You
Harrison


I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
I've got time
I've got time

I Will
Lennon/McCartney


Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely life time
If you want me to I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do  endear you to me
And you know I will
I will
Ooo, la


I'll Be Back
Lennon/McCartney


You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so, oh
I'm the one who wants you
Yes I'm the one who wants you
oh, ho, oh, ho, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I run away from you
that you would want me to
But I got a big surprise
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh

You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again


I'll Cry Instead
Lennon/McCartney


I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
but I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when you do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead


I'll Follow The Sun
Lennon/McCartney


One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain,
so I'll follow the sun

Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain,
so I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
and, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain,
so I'll follow the sun
But tomorrow may rain,
so I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
and, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain,
so I'll follow the sun


I'll Get You
Lennon/McCartney


Oh yeah, oh yeah,
oh yeah, oh yeah,
Imagine I'm in love with you
it's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you
I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end

Oh yeah, oh yeah
I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you
I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end

Oh yeah
Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind
So you might as well resign yourself to me

Oh yeah,

I've imagined I'm in love with you
many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend

I'm A Loser
Lennon/McCartney


I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be


I'm Down
Lennon/McCartney


You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
I'm down, I'm down, I''m down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down

Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing gappen every day
I'm down, I'm down, I''m down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down

We're all alone and there's nobody else
Se'll still moan "Keep your hands to yourself"
I'm down, I'm down, I''m down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down, woo

A baby you know I'm down
I guess I'm down
I'm down on the ground
I'm down
Ah, baby I'm upside down
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm down


I'm Happy Just To Dance With You
Lennon/McCartney


Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

I'm Looking Through You
Lennon/McCartney


I'm looking through you
Where did you go
I thought I knew you
What did I know
You don't look different
But you have changed
I'm looking through you
You're not the same

Your lips are moving
I cannot hear
You voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear
You don't sound different
I've learned the game
I'm looking through you
You're not the same

Why, tell me why
Did you not treat me right
Love has a nasty habit
Of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me
The same old way
You were above me
But not today
The only difference
Is you're down there
I'm looking though you
And you're nowhere

Why, tell me why
Did you not treat me right
Love has a nasty habit
Of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you
Where did you go
I thought I knew you
What did I know
You don't look different
But you have changed
I'm looking through you
You're not the same
Yeah, Oh, baby you've changed
Aah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You've changed, you've changed

I'm Only Sleeping
Lennon/McCartney


When I wake up early in the morning,
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

Please don't wake me, no
don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find, there's no need

Please don't spoil my day 
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

Please don't spoil my day 
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning,
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

Please don't wake me, no
don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping


I'm So Tired
Lennon/McCartney


I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you'd do
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke
It's doing me harm, you know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain, you know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got 
for a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke
It's doing me harm, you know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain, you know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got 
for a little peace of mind
give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

All that I was looking for was somebody
who looked like you

oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling that everybody knows
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I've Just Seen A Face
Lennon/McCartney


I've just seen a face 
I can't forget the time or place where we just met 
she's just the girl for me
and I want all the world to see we've met
Mm mm mm mm mm mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
and I'd have never been aware
but as it is I'll dream of her tonight
La la la la la la

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again

I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and I have missed things
and kept out of sight
for other girls were never quite like this
Da da da da da da

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again
Yeah, pa pa pa pa

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again

I've just seen a face 
I can't forget the time or place where we just met

And she keeps calling
me back again
Falling, yes I am falling

If I Fell
Lennon/McCartney


If I fell in love with you
could you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love is more
That just holding hands

If I gave my love to you
I must be sure from the very start
that you would love me more than her

If I trust in you, oh please
don't run and hide, 
if I love you too, oh please
don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
would love to love you
And that see will cry
when she learns we are two

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
would love to love you
And that see will cry
when she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you


If I Needed Someone
Harrison


If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
That I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day 
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
That I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day 
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah


In My Life
Lennon/McCartney


There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more


It Won't Be Long
Lennon/McCartney


It won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh

It won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh
It won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home

You're coming home, you're coming home

Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry

It won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh
It won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh
It won't be long yeh, till I belong to you

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home

It's All Too Much
Harrison


It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes
You love is there for me
And the more I go inside
the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
the love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time
form life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
the love that's shining all around you
All the world is birthday cake
so take a piece but not too much

Sell me on a silver sun
where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere
and get me home for tea

It's all too much for me to see
the love that's shining all around you
The more I learn, the less I know
and what I do it's all too much

It's all too much for me to take
the love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
it's all too much

It's all too much
It's all too much


It's Only Love
Lennon/McCartney


I get high when I see you go by 
My oh my when you sigh my
my inside just flies
Butterflies why am I so shy
when I'm beside you

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should flight
Every night just the sight 
of you make nighttime bright
Very bright haven't I the right
to make up girl

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you
Loving you

Lady Madonna
Lennon/McCartney


Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa...
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Living in the world agree

still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Shine until tomorrow

Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer

Love You To
Harrison


Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

A life time is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to


Lovely Rita
Lennon/McCartney


Lovely Rita meter maid
nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
when I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
may I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me

Took her out and tried to win her
had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two

Lovely Rita meter maid
where would I be without you
give us a wink and make me think of you

Lovely meter maid
Rita meter maid
oh, Lovely Rita meter, meter maid


Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
Lennon/McCartney


Picture yourself on a boat in a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes 
and she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
that grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxies appear on the shores
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
and you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah

Picture yourself in a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah


Maggie Mae
Arranged by Lennon/McCartney/Harrison/Starkey


Oh, dirty Maggie Mae
they have taken her away
and she'll never walk 
down Lime Street anymore

Oh, the judge she guilty found her
of robbing the bomeward bounder
dirty no good robbin' Maggie Mae

(It's the part of Liverpool
She returned me to
Two pound ten a week 
that was my pay)

Martha my dear though I 
spend days in conversation

Martha my love don't forget me

Matchbox
Perkins


I said I'm sitting here watching 
matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering 
matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
but I sure got a long way to go

I'm an old poor boy 
I'm a long way from home
I'm an old poor boy
and I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
cause everything I ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches
honey please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches
honey, please don't mess around my tree
I've got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery, all right!

Well let me be your little dog
till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
watch how your puppy dog runs

Well I said I'm sitting here watching 
matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering 
matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
but I sure got a long way to go


Maxwell's Silver Hammer
Lennon/McCartney


Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical 
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with her a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures Jo-o-o-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant scene-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be so-o-o-o
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
made sure that she was dead

P.C. thirty one said "we've caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so-o-o-o
But, as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes form behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
made sure that he was dead
Silver hammer man


Mean Mr. Mustard
Lennon/McCartney


Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
shaves in the dark, tries to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy him some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
she never stops, she's a go getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man


Michelle
Lennon/McCartney


Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well

I love you

I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you some how
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont tre's bien ensemble
Tre's bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle

Sit beside a mountain stream

No Reply
Lennon/McCartney


This happened once before
when I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
but I saw you peep through
your window

I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'cause I looked up to see
your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
that's a lie
'cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in
your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
'cause you walked hand in hand
with another man
in my place

If I were you
I'd realize that I
love you more
than any other guy
And I'll forgive
the lies that I
heard before
when you gave me no reply

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
that's a lie
'cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in
your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
'cause you walked hand in hand
with another man
in my place

Norwegian Wood
Lennon/McCartney


I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me get room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time 
drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"it's time for bed"

She told me she worked 
in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't 
and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?


Not A Second Time
Lennon/McCartney


You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine

You're back again

Nowhere Man
Lennon/McCartney


He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, The world is at your command

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man, can you see me at all
Nowhere man don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
Lends you a hand
Ah, la, la, la, la

Doesn't have a point of view
knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Octopus's Garden
Starkey


I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
In an octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
We would be so happy you and me
No on e there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
in an octopus's garden with you
in an octopus's garden with you

Believe me when I tell you

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone

Old Brown Shoe
Harrison


I want a love that's right
Right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short-haired girl
who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

Pick me up from where
some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
replacing every thoughtless frown
So escaping from this zoo
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here 
it won't be the same now when I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer
wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you'll say
I'll live and love and maybe some day
who knows baby, you may comfort me, heh

I may appear to be imperfect
my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster that the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows baby, you may comfort me

I know my love is yours to miss
that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here 
it won't be the same now when I'm with you

I'm so glad you came here 
it won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tu la, tu ru tu


One After 909
Lennon/McCartney


My baby says she's traveling 
on the one after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once
Move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
I said I'm traveling 
on the one after 909

I begged her not to go
and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around
You're only fooling around with me
I said move over once
Move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
I said I'm traveling 
on the one after 909

I've got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Picked up my bags, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well, I said I'm traveling
on the one after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once
Move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice

I've got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location (yeah)
Picked up my bags, run right home (run right home)
Then I find I've got the number wrong

I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once
Move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
I said I'm traveling
on the one after 909

Only A Northern Song
Harrison


If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night
You may think the bands are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern Song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear 
or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song

If you think the harmony
Is a lttle dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there


P.S. I Love You
Lennon/McCartney

Penny Lane
Lennon/McCartney


Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs 
of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go stop to say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motor car
the little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a "mac" in the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in

Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my ears
Full of fish and finger pies
in summer meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane


Piggies
Harrison


Have you see the little piggies 
crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt
to play around in

Have you see the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts
to play around in

In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a darn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives
to eat their bacon

One more time

Polythene Pam
Lennon/McCartney


Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good looking
But she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
dressed in a polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeh, yeh, yeh

Get a dose of her in jackboot and kilt
She's killer diller when 
she's dressed to the hilt
She's the knid of a girl 
that makes the news of the world
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeh, yeh, yeh


Rain
Lennon/McCartney


If the rain comes 
they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes

When the sun shines 
they slip into the shade
and sip their lemonade
When the sun shines
When the sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you 
that when it starts to rain
everything's the same
I can show you
I can show you

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

Can you hear me
that when it rains and shines
it's just a state of mind
Can you hear me
Can you hear me


Revolution
Lennon/McCartney


You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
all right, all right

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can
But when you want money 
for people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
all right, all right
Ah

ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
all right, all right
all right, all right, all right
all right, all right, all right

Rock And Roll Music
Berry

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurrican'

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me


Rocky Raccoon
Lennon/McCartney


Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota, 
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon(na)
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that he said I'm gonna get that boy
so one day he walked into town
Booked himself in the local saloon

Rock Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky hand come equipped with the gun
to shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girls of his dreams
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy

Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a show down

Daniel was hot he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Da, da, da, da, da

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better
I'll be better doc as soon as I am able

And now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
Ah, oh yeah, yeah
Da, da, da, da

Savoy Truffle
Harrison


Creme tangerine and montelimar
a ginger sling with a pineapple heart
a coffee dessert yes you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pull out 
after the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel you taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pull out 
after the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
but when the pain cuts through
you're  gonna know and how
The sweat is gonna fill you head
when it becomes too much, you'll shout aloud

But you'll have to have them all pull out 
after the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
but what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know ob-bla-di-bla-da
but can you show me where you are

Creme tangerine and montelimar
a ginger sling with a pineapple heart
a coffee dessert yes you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pull out 
after the Savoy truffle
Yes, you'll have to have them all pull out 
after the Savoy truffle

Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie she's the latest

She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Lennon/McCartney


She came in through the bathroom window
protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her
Didn't anybody see
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she's always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the Police Department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her
Didn't anybody see
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh, yeah

And she told me what to say-yi-yay

She says she loves you

Yes, she loves you

She Said She Said
Lennon/McCartney


She said I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

I said who put all the things in your head
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born

She said you don't understand what I said
I said no, no, no you're wrong
When I was a boy, everything was right
Everything was right

I said even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born

She said you don't understand what I said
I said no, no, no you're wrong

Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever

She's Leaving Home
Lennon/McCartney


Wednesday morning at five o'clock
as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen 
clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free

She (we gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
home (we gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone for 
so many years (bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

She (We never thought of ourselves)
is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone for 
so many years (bye bye)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (what did we do that was wrong)
is having (we didn't know it was wrong)
fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied for 
so many years (bye bye)
She's leaving home (bye bye)


Slow Down
Williams


Well, come on pretty baby won't you walk with me
Come on pretty baby won't you talk with me
Come on pretty baby give me one more chance
Try and save our romance
Slow down

Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little loving

Ow, if you want our love to last

Well I used to walk you home baby after school
Carry your books home, too
But now you  got a boyfriend down the street
Baby what're you trying to do a do
You better slow down

Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little loving

The best little woman I ever had
Slow down

Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little loving
gimme little loving
Ow, if you want our love to last


Something
Harrison


Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how


Strawberry Fields Forever
Lennon/McCartney


Let me take you down
cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down
cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you know you can't tune it
but It's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down
cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Always know sometimes it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "No" will mean a "Yes"
but it's all wrong
that is I think I disagree

Let me take you down
cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
strawberry fields forever

Taxman
Harrison


Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman

If you drive a car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman

'Cause I'm the taxman,
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me


Tell Me What You See
Lennon/McCartney


If you let me take your heart
I will prove to you
We will never be apart
If I'm part of you
Open up you eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Big and black the cloud may be
Time will pass away
If you put your trust in me
I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now
Tell me what you see
Don't you realize now
What you see is me
Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through

Tryin' to get to you
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see

Tell Me Why
Lennon/McCartney


Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'cause I really can't stand it
I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

The Ballad Of John And Yoko
Lennon/McCartney


Standing in the dock at Southampton
trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said
you've got to go back
You know they didn't even give us a chance

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown call to say
you can make it O.K.
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said 
say what're you doing in bed
I said we're only trying to get us some peace

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy when you're dead
you don't take nothing with you but your soul, think

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said
she's gone to his head
They look just like to Gurus in drag

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press
said we wish you successs
It's good to have the both of you back

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me


The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill
Lennon/McCartney


Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marval zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce" his mommy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill
Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill

Love you, love you
love you, love you...

And in the end, the love you take
is equal to the love you make


The Inner Light
Harrison

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing


The Long And Winding Road
Lennon/McCartney


The long and winding road
that leads to your door
will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me her
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
and many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
the many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
to the long winding road
You left me standing here
a long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
to the long winding road
You left me standing here
a long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


The Night Before
Lennon/McCartney


We said our good-byes
Love was in your eyes
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you telling lies?
Was I so unwise
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before, yeah

Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry

We said our good-byes
Love was in your eyes
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before, yes

When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry

Were you telling lies?
Was I so unwise
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before


The Word
Lennon/McCartney


Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love


There's A Place
Lennon/McCartney


There, there's a place 
where I can go
when I feel low 
when I feel blue
And it's my mind 
and there's time
When I'm alone 
I think of you
the things you do
Go round my head
the things you've said

Like I love only you
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

There, there's a place 
where I can go
when I feel low 
when I feel blue
And it's my mind 
and there's time
When I'm alone 
There's a place
There's a place


Things We Said Today
Lennon/McCartney


You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

You said you'll be mine, girl
'til the end of time
These days such a kind girl
seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine, girl
believe only one
loves me all the time, girl
we'll go on and on

Some day when we're dreaming
deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine, girl
believe only one
loves me all the time, girl
we'll go on and on

Some day when we're dreaming
deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today


Think For Yourself
Harrison

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
if we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the thighs that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'cause I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'cause I won't be there with you


This Boy
Lennon/McCartney


That boy took my love away
Oh, he'll regret it some day
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh, my, oh
That boy won't be happy
till he's seen you cry

This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

This boy, this boy...


Ticket To Ride
Lennon/McCartney

I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
but she don't care

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
but she don't care

I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think right
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think right
She ought to do right by me

I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah, oh
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
but she don't care

I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think right
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think right
She ought to do right by me

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
but she don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care


Till There Was You
Willson


There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
they tell me in in sweet fragrant meadows
of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
Bo I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
they tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you


Tomorrow Never Knows
Lennon/McCartney


Turn off your mind, relax
and float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying

Lay down all thought
Surrender to the void
It is shining
It is shining

That you may see
The meaning of within
It is being
It is being

That love is all
And love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing

That ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing

But listen to the 
color of your dreams
It is not living
It is not living

Or play the game 
existence to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning

Russell/Medley


Well, shake it up baby now

Two Of Us
Lennon/McCartney


Two of us riding nowhere
spending someone's hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving on our way back home
We're on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
lifting latches on our way back home
We're on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
longer that that road
that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
getting nowhere on our way back home
We're on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
longer that that road
that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
getting nowhere on our way back home
We're on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're going home
We're going home


Wait
Lennon/McCartney


It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh, how I've been alone


We Can Work It Out
Lennon/McCartney


Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that or love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's all right
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and there's no time
for fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell of I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your
There's a chance we might fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and there's no time
for fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's all right
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out


What Goes On
Lennon/McCartney/Starkey


What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

I met you in the morning
waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no on else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
in your mind
in your mind


What You're Doing
Lennon/McCartney


Look, what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
what you're doing to me

You got me running
and there's no fun in it
Why should it be too much to ask of you
what you're doing to me

I've been waiting here for you
wondering what you're gonna do
should you need a love that's true
it's me

Please stop your lying
you got me crying, girl
Why should it be too much to ask of you
what you're doing to me

I've been waiting here for you
wondering what you're gonna do
should you need a love that's true
it's me

Please stop your lying
you got me crying, girl
Why should it be too much to ask of you
what you're doing to me
What you're doing to me
What you're doing to me


When I Get Home
Lennon/McCartney


Whoa, ah,  woah, ah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
when I get home
Come on, I'm on my way
'cause I'm a gonna see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say
to her

Whoa, ah,  woah, ah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
when I get home

Come on, if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me
tonight

Whoa, ah,  woah, ah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
when I get home

When I'm getting home tonight
I'm gonna hold her tight
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home
I be I'll love her more
till I walk out that door again

Come on, let me through
I got so many things I gotta do
I got no business being here with you
this way

Whoa, ah,  woah, ah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
when I get home
Yeah, I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
when I get home


When I'm Sixty-Four
Lennon/McCartney


When I get older losing my hair
many years from now
will you still be sending me a valentine
birthday greeting, bottle of wine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
would you lock the door
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy mending a fuse
when your light have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

Every summer we can rent a cottage on the 
Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
stating point of view
indicate precisely what you mean to say
yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer fill in a form
mine forever more
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four


While My Guitar Gently Weeps
Harrison


I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it need sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
how to unfold you love
I don't know how someone controlled you
they bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
you were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
no on altered you

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

Oh, oh, oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah


Why Don't We Do It In The Road
Lennon/McCartney


Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road 
Why don't we do it in the road 
Why don't we do it in the road
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road

With A Little Help From My Friends
Lennon/McCartney


What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not o sing out of key

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you're on your own

No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody
I need somebody to love

Within You Without You
Harrison


We were talking 
about the space between us all
and people who hide themselves 
behind a wall of illusion
never glimpse the truth
then it's far too late
when they pass away

We were talking
about the love we all could share
When we find it
to try our best to hold it there
with our love, with our love
we could save the world
if they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
no one else ca make you change
And to see you're really only very small
and life flows on within you and without you

We were talking
about the love that's gone so cold
and the people who gain the world
and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see
Are you one of them

When you've seen beyond yourself
then you may find
peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come
when you see we're all one
and life flows on within you and without you


Words Of Love
Holly

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
um, um, um, um

Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
um, um, um, um

Let me hear you say
the words I long to gear
Darling when you're near
um, um, um, um

Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
um, um, um, um
um, um, um
ah, ah, ah


Yellow Submarine
Lennon/McCartney

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
in our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

(Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sgt.
Cut the cable, drop the cable
Aye, Sir, aye
Captain, captain)

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine


Yer Blues
Lennon/McCartney

Yes I'm lonely wanna die
Yes I'm lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh, girl you know the reason why

In the morning wanna die
In the evening wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh, girl you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh, girl you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh, girl you know the reason why

The black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll wanna die
Yeah, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh, girl you know the reason why

Yes, I'm lonely wanna die
Yes, I'm lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh, girl you know the reason why
Yes, I'm lonely wanna die


Yes It Is
Lennon/McCartney


If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
Of red is color that my baby wore

Yes it is

Scarlet were clothes she wore
Everybody know I'm sure

Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forger her, but's it's my pride
Yes it is, Oh, yes it is, yeh

Yesterday
Lennon/McCartney


Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it look as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
oh, I believe in yesterday, Mm


You Can't Do That
Lennon/McCartney


I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
and leave you flat
Because I told you before
oh, you can't do that

Well it's the second time I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time I think it's a sin
I think I'll let you down
and leave you flat
Because I told you before
oh, you can't do that

Everybody's green
'cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
you talking that way
they'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can't help this feeling I'll go out of my mind
You know I'll let you down
and leave you flat
Because I told you before
oh, you can't do that, wah

Everybody's green
'cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
you talking that way
they'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can't help this feeling I'll go out of my mind
You know I'll let you down
and leave you flat
Because I told you before
oh, you can't do that

You, you know, you know my name

(Good evening and welcome to slaggers featuring Denis O'Bell
Come on Ringo, Let's here it for Denis O'Bell, good evening)

You Like Me Too Much
Harrison

Though you're gone away this morning
you'll be back again tonight
telling me there'll be no next time
if I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've tried before to leave me
but you haven't got the nerve
to walk out and make me lonely
which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do

And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring
you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'cause you like me too much and I like you

'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do

And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring
you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'cause you like me too much and I like you
'cause you like me too much and I like you


You Never Give Me Your Money
Lennon/McCartney


You never give me your money
you only give me you funny paper
And in the middle of negotiation you break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down

Out of college money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go

But oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
nowhere to go
nowhere to go
Ah, Ooo, Ah, Ooo, Ah

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream
Came true today
Came true today
Came true today

One two three four five six seven
All good children go to heaven


You Won't See Me
Lennon/McCartney


When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
that was so hard to find
And I will lost my mind
If you won't see me
you won't see me

I don't know why 
you should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't gave much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me
you won't see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
you won't see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
you won't see me

Though she was born a long, long time ago

You've Got To Hide Your Love Away
Lennon/McCartney


Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare 
each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away


You Really Got A Hold On Me

I don't like you
But I love you
See that I'm always
thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh,
you treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you,
but I need you
Don't want to kiss you
but I need you
Oh, oh, oh

my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I want to leave you
don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend 
another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now

You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
